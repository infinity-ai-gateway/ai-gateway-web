# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [v0.0.9] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Certificate management re-enabled: route `certs.list` at `/cert` with list (name, default tag, expiry), global default certificate selector, create drawer (PEM upload + client-side expiry preview), and delete guard for the default certificate
- Operation logs module: new `OperationLogs` at `/operation-logs` with time-range filter, server-side pagination, column search, and 720px detail drawer with change summary (`vue-json-viewer` for before/after JSON)
- `utils/cert.js`: `parseCertExpiredDate` parses `notAfter` from the first PEM certificate block for create-form preview
- User manual (zh-cn): chapters 11 (certificates) and 12 (operation logs) with screenshots; chapter order places both immediately after route management
- sys-design: new per-module docs for certificate management and operation logs; updated routing, module overview, OpenAPI mapping, overall design, i18n design, `summary.md`, and `design-docs/README.md`

### Changed

- Certificate create form aligned with OpenAPI: removed manual `expired_date` input; submit body includes `cert_name`, `description`, `is_default`, `cert_file_content`, and `key_file_content` only
- Certificate default switch uses `PATCH /certificates/{cert_name}/default` (replacing legacy PUT usage in docs)
- Certificate name/description validation aligned with API rules (`CertNameRegCheck`, `CertDescriptionRegCheck`); first certificate auto-set as default when none exists
- Expanded i18n coverage for `cert`, `operationLogs`, and navigation labels (en/zh)

## [v0.0.8] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Model Provider module: new `/providers` resource with list, create/edit/view drawers, instance pool, model protocols, model discovery endpoint, auth keys, and model list; clusters reference providers via `llm_config.provider` instead of maintaining instance pools locally
- Provider model discovery: stateless `POST /providers/tools/discover-models` replaces legacy `tools/get-models-from-provider`; models are fetched from the current form and persisted only on submit
- Provider pricing tiers: independent drawer for peak busy-hour schedules (`time_zone` + weekday/time ranges) via `PUT /providers/{name}/pricing-tiers`, with IANA timezone validation
- Provider list shortcuts: **Query model prices** navigates to Model Prices filtered by `provider` and auto-opens the first matching record
- Model pricing tier prices: create/edit/detail views now support required default `prices` plus optional `tier_prices.peak` for time-based rates aligned with provider pricing tiers
- Cluster Key affinity: `key_affinity` (enable, idle TTL, penalty, Redis prefix) in LLM config for session-bound key routing
- Route expression primitives: `req_body_json_prefix_in` for JSON body field prefix matching; `req_body_larger_than` / `req_body_less_than` for Content-Length based matching
- User manual v0.0.8: new Model Provider chapter, updated AI Business Cluster (5-step wizard), model pricing tier docs, and refreshed screenshots for chapters 04–11

### Changed

- Cluster wizard simplified from 6 steps to 5: removed the instance-pool step; instance pools are owned by Model Provider; cluster create/update payloads no longer include `instance_pool`
- Cluster LLM config refactor: select **provider** to load forward models and key names; keys table stores `name` + `weight` only (no key plaintext); removed `provider_type` and embedded `model_endpoint`
- `InstancePool.vue` reused by Model Provider; duplicate `addr:port` rows are highlighted and blocked on submit
- API Key rate-limit rules: TPM/RPM rule names follow `RateLimitRuleNameRegCheck`; persisted rule names are read-only in the form
- Model Prices list accepts `provider` and `autoView` query params for deep-linking from the provider list
- Expanded i18n coverage for providers, pricing tiers, tier prices, key affinity, and route body expressions (en/zh)

### Fixed

- Instance pool duplicate address/port validation and visual feedback (#85)

### Removed

- Legacy model-provider-types module and `tools/get-models-from-provider` consumption path

## [v0.0.7] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Model pricing module: new `ModelPrices` module with list (server-side pagination and filters), detail, create/edit, YAML import, routing, menu icon, and i18n coverage
- Route rule fallbacks: forms, detail views, and submissions now persist `fallbacks`; added cross `targets` / `fallbacks` duplicate validation for `(cluster_name, model)` combinations
- Route expression primitive `req_body_json_prefix_in` for matching JSON body field prefixes (e.g. OpenRouter `openrouter/` model prefix)
- Cluster LLM multi-key weighted routing: `llm_config` supports `keys` (name/key/weight) and `key_policy` (strategy/max_retries/retry_backoff)
- Cluster LLM price-table binding and prefix handling: `provider` for pricing lookup; `match_prefix` / `strip_prefix` for aggregated providers (e.g. OpenRouter); review and detail views display these fields
- API-Key / Entity RMB quota: `quota_plan.unit` supports `RMB`; cap 90,000,000.00 with 4-decimal display; reset quota dialog respects unit and cap
- `pageTable` server-side pagination: `server-pagination` with `total`/`currentPage`/`pageSize` and `on-page-change`/`on-search-change`; used by route tables and model pricing

### Changed

- Route rule field naming aligned to OpenAPI snake_case: `Cond`/`ClusterName`/`Model`/`Weight` → `cond`/`cluster_name`/`model`/`weight`

### Fixed

- Cluster instance ports now sync with the http/https schema when fetching models and submitting cluster config
- Model pricing duplicate-combination validation no longer false-positives when the backend returns an empty object or empty list
- Model pricing upsert now rejects negative `limits` (must be non-negative integers) and negative `prices`

## [v0.0.6] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Route Table module: unified route table management with Global/Entity/API-Key table types, list and detail views, enable/disable toggle, and inline edit mode for route rules
- Weighted routing and fallback: multi-target clusters with weight allocation (weights must sum to 100), fallback cluster and model configuration, and transparent model transmission
- Design documentation: added `design-docs` covering prototype pages, system design (architecture, modules, routing, state, i18n, components, OpenAPI mapping, build & deployment) and per-module detail documents
- Stricter input validation: tightened cluster name, username, password, and token name rules (length limits, leading/trailing characters, reserved names) and added hostname validation utility
- Expanded i18n coverage: added English and Chinese translations for route table, weighted routing, and validation hints

### Changed

- Route management refactor: aligned with the new OpenAPI; replaced legacy Default Route Rule and Advance Route Rule modules with the Route Table module, and updated router paths (`router`/`ai-rule` replaced by `route-tables`)
- Cluster wizard alignment: unified default values and API payload formatting for basic config, timeout, and passive health check; health check host now defaults to the first instance in the instance pool when left blank
- Instance pool restructure: instance entries now use address/port/weight with inline editing; weight range adjusted to 0-100; provider domain also accepts IP addresses; at least one instance must have a weight greater than 0
- Session persistence simplified from instance/sub-cluster levels to a single session sticky toggle
- `pageTable` sorting enhanced to support nested (dot-notation) field keys with immutable sorting
- API Key form: entity selector is now clearable

### Fixed

- Fixed validation and interaction issues in route table rule forms (duplicate rule names, duplicated target/fallback cluster-model combinations)
- Fixed interaction and formatting issues in cluster basic config and gateway config forms
- Fixed sorting behavior in `pageTable` for nested field data

## [v0.0.5] - 2026-07-24

- Consumer management enhancements: improved Entity create/edit/view flows and hierarchical organization support
- API Key enhancements: refined API Key list, detail, and upsert components with better quota and rate-limit handling
- Expanded i18n coverage: updated English and Chinese translations for consumer, cluster, and route management

### Changed
